# CreditCardFraudDetection
In 2018, unauthorised financial fraud losses across payment cards and remote banking totalled £844.8 million in the United Kingdom. Whereas banks and card companies prevented £1.66 billion in unauthorised fraud in 2018. That is the equivalent to £2 in every £3 of attempted fraud being stopped.
Credit cards are more secure than ever, with regulators, card providers and banks taking considerable time and effort to collaborate with investigators worldwide to ensure fraudsters aren't successful. Cardholders' money is usually protected from scammers with regulations that make the card provider and bank accountable. The technology and security measures behind credit cards are becoming increasingly sophisticated making it harder for fraudsters to steal money.
My model takes a dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud having over 280,000 transactions. It predicts the transaction as fraud or genuine wiht the accuracy of 99.69%. 
To predict I am using the Unsupervised Outlier Detection method Local Outlier Factor from the SkLearn.neighbours class.
